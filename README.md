# Jack Gale Website

This repository is a Next.js application using the `staworth-dot-com` structure as the base template, refactored for `jackgale-dot-uk`.

## Notes

- Legacy static site files are archived in `/archive/pre-refactor-static-site`.
- External API integrations were intentionally removed from page behavior.
- Presence links and legacy publication images were migrated from the previous site.
- Legacy `products.html` publication entries were migrated into markdown files under `src/content/articles`.

## Run

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
