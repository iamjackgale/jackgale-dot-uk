This policy explains what personal data may be processed through this website and how it is handled.

## Scope

This policy applies to the website available at the domains and subdomains operated for this project.

## Data We Process

If you contact us by email, we may process:

- your email address;
- the contents of your message; and
- any details you include in your communication.

This site does not intentionally collect special category personal data. Please avoid sending sensitive data unless necessary.

## Lawful Bases

Where applicable under UK GDPR, processing is carried out on the basis of:

- legitimate interests (responding to messages and operating the site);
- performance of pre-contract or contract steps (where relevant); and
- legal obligations (where required).

## Cookies and Analytics

This site currently does not rely on third-party tracking APIs as part of this refactor. If analytics or additional services are reintroduced, this section will be updated.

## Retention

Personal data is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purpose it was collected, or to satisfy legal and compliance obligations.

## Sharing

Data may be shared with essential infrastructure providers where required to operate email or hosting services. Data is not sold.

## Your Rights

Subject to applicable law, you may request access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, or portability of your personal data.

To exercise these rights, contact [{{CONTACT_TO_EMAIL}}](mailto:{{CONTACT_TO_EMAIL}}).

## Complaints

You may raise complaints with your local data protection authority, including the UK Information Commissioner's Office where applicable.
